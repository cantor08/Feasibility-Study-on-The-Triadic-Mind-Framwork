# 📘 Triadic Mind Framework  
**Feasibility-Driven Analysis of Decision-Making Under Uncertainty**

## Overview

This repository contains a **research-oriented analytical report** developed through an in-depth study of **50+ peer-reviewed research papers** across cognitive science, mental health, uncertainty modeling, and decision theory.

The goal of this project is **not to build a predictive model**, but to answer a more fundamental question that precedes modeling:

> **What kinds of decisions are feasible given the nature of the data, cognition, and uncertainty involved?**

To address this, the report introduces the **Triadic Mind Framework**, a conceptual pipeline that explains how raw information is transformed into decisions under cognitive and emotional constraints.

## Motivation

Many data-driven systems force **binary decisions** (yes/no, risk/no-risk, positive/negative), even when:
- evidence is incomplete,
- signals are ambiguous,
- or human interpretation is involved.

This project argues that **binary reasoning is often misaligned with real-world data and human cognition**, especially in mental-health and human-centered domains.

Instead, it proposes a **triadic perspective** that explicitly represents uncertainty and deferment.

## The Triadic Mind Framework

The **Triadic Mind Framework** models mental processing as a **six-stage pipeline**:

1. **Mental Input**  
   Raw signals from sensory input, bodily states, memory, and social context.

2. **Cognitive Load Filtering**  
   Processing constraints imposed by limited working memory (Cognitive Load Theory).

3. **Emotional Appraisal**  
   Rapid evaluation of relevance, threat, and coping capacity.

4. **Meaning Construction (SMV)**  
   Interpretation of symbols into meaning, shaped by underlying values.

5. **Three-Way Decision (3WD)**  
   Decisions are categorized into:
   - **Accept**
   - **Reject**
   - **Defer** (explicit uncertainty region)

6. **Behavior / Outcome**  
   Decisions manifest as actions, judgments, or system outputs.

This framework emphasizes that **deferment is not indecision**, but a **necessary cognitive and ethical mechanism** when evidence is insufficient.

## Theoretical Foundations

This work synthesizes five major theoretical perspectives:

- **Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)** – limitations of working memory  
- **Appraisal Theory of Emotion** – fast, pre-conscious evaluation  
- **Symbol–Meaning–Value (SMV) Space** – how meaning and values shape cognition  
- **Three-Way Decision (3WD) Theory** – accept / reject / defer reasoning  
- **Neuroscience of spontaneous thought** – non-linear mental processing  

### Academic Credit

The concepts of **Three-Way Decision (3WD)** and **Symbol–Meaning–Value (SMV) space** are credited to:

> **Dr. Yiyu Yao**  
> Department of Computer Science, University of Regina

These ideas form the **theoretical backbone** of the framework and are explicitly acknowledged throughout the report.

## Applications Discussed

The framework is examined through examples drawn from the literature, including:

- EEG-based depression detection  
- Clinical diagnostic reasoning  
- Autism detection under domain shift  
- Social-media mental-health risk monitoring  

Across these domains, the analysis shows that:
- triadic patterns already exist implicitly,
- but making the **defer region explicit** improves safety, interpretability, and feasibility.

## Why This Project Matters

This repository is relevant for:

- **Data scientists** working with ambiguous or human-centered data  
- **Researchers** interested in uncertainty-aware decision modeling  
- **AI practitioners** designing interpretable and safe systems  
- **Students** learning how to conduct feasibility analysis before modeling  

The project demonstrates a **literature-first, feasibility-driven approach** to data-related problems.

## How to Use This Work

- Read the report to understand **triadic decision modeling**
- Use the framework as a **conceptual feasibility layer** before building models
- Adapt the triadic structure for:
  - data analysis,
  - system design,
  - or scientific communication
